# Company-Project-1

This repository contains components and utilities extracted and refactored from a React Native employee self-service application I developed as a company project.

## 🧩 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to showcase my experience in building real-world mobile apps, even though the original app was part of a professional, private project.

> Note: This project is a simplified and public-safe version of a real project. No private or proprietary code has been included.
