# Company-Project-1

This repository contains components and utilities extracted and refactored from a React Native employee self-service application I developed as part of a company project.

I was the sole React Native developer on the project and was responsible for building the application from scratch — including architecture, navigation, API integration, UI components, and state management.

All shared code is generalized and stripped of any proprietary or sensitive information. This repo demonstrates the type of work I've done professionally.

## 💡 What’s Included

- ✅ Reusable components: `CustomButton`, `DropdownCustom`, `LoadingView`
- ✅ Clean and consistent code structure
- ✅ React Native best practices
- ✅ Navigation Methods

## 🔔 Push Notification Integration

This project includes a sample setup using:

- `@react-native-firebase/messaging` for FCM push notifications
- `@notifee/react-native` for displaying rich local notifications
- React Native Navigation for screen management
All sensitive information and app-specific screen names have been replaced with safe placeholders.
  
## 🌐 API Integration

This project demonstrates clean API integration using Axios with an MVP-inspired pattern.

- API requests are handled in the `/api` service layer
- Presenters abstract the business logic and communicate with screens
- Error and loading states are managed in the UI layer
  
## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- React Native
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## 🧩 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to showcase my experience in building real-world mobile apps, even though the original app was part of a professional, private project.

> Note: This project is a simplified and public-safe version of a real project. No private or proprietary code has been included.
